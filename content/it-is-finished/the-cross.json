        "development": "Heaven beheld the Victim betrayed and hurried from one tribunal to another. It heard the sneers of His persecutors and the denial by one of His best-loved disciples. Heaven viewed with grief and amazement Christ hanging upon the cross, blood flowing from His wounded temples and sweat tinged with blood upon His brow. His labored breath grew quick and deep, as His soul panted under the burden of the sins of the world. All heaven was filled with wonder at His prayer amidst terrible suffering: 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.'",

        "development": "As a Conqueror, Christ planted His banner on the eternal heights. The cry, 'It is finished,' had a deep significance for the angels and the unfallen worlds. Satan's disguise was torn away. His administration was laid open before the universe. By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had revealed himself as a murderer and uprooted himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. The last link of sympathy between Satan and the heavenly world was broken.",

He offers this character as a free gift. His life stands for the life of men, granting remission for past sins. More than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes of God, building up human character in the similitude of the divine. Thus the very righteousness of the law is fulfilled in the believer, and God can be just while justifying those who believe.",
