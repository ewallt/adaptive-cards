Some months later, after His disciples had been away from Him, they returned to find Him absorbed in communion with God.

His days were filled with incessant labor, ministering to crowds and debating with the rabbis, leaving Him utterly wearied.

They came to understand that His divine power and heavenly wisdom were a direct result of this communion.",
