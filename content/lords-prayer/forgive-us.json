He makes this a clear condition: 'If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.'

While it is their part to humble their hearts by repentance, our part is to have a spirit of compassion, whether or not they confess their faults.

It is not only forgiveness *for* sin, but reclaiming *from* sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love that transforms the heart.
